The TryHackMe “SOC Simulator” service is an interactive platform designed to simulate real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) environments. The simulator includes a dashboard, alert queue, built in SIEM (Splunk) and an analyst VM workstation for threat intel investigations. 

It provides scenarios involving phishing attacks, malware, and insider threats, requiring users to investigate alerts, classify incidents, and write reports. The purpose of this project is to practice incident response skills in a simulated realistic setting, document the investigative process, and provide possible recommendations based on the findings. 

The SOC Simulator service includes 7 unique scenarios to tackle as a simulated SOC analyst. However, most of these scenarios are restricted to Business users, intended for corporate environments only. For individual users, only two scenarios are currently accessible to premium users like myself, both centered around phishing-based threats.
